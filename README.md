### About Me

- 🧑‍💻 My main language is **Python**, but I like to experiment with:
  - C#
  - C++
  - JavaScript
  - C (for now)
- 🤖 I enjoy AI, machine learning, and tech experiments.
- 🛠️ Most of my repos are me learning, tinkering, or trying new things.  
  Sometimes stuff works. Sometimes it doesn't. That's part of the vibe.

### What you'll find here

- Random Python scripts, game prototypes, and experiments
- AI projects and quirky ideas
- Both successful builds and total failures—both are welcome!

**P.S.**  
I'm an introvert, so don't expect a lot of chatting here.

**P.S.S.**
Generated by AI 'cause im lazy.

Maybe I'll open my repositories one day. Might be not tho.
